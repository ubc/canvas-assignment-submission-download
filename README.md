# Canvas Assignment Submission Downloader

This script downloads all submissions for all assignments from a Canvas course using the Canvas API.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (3.8+ required).

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository** (or place the script in your project folder).
2. **Create a `.env` file** in the same directory as the script and add your Canvas credentials:

   ```ini
   CANVAS_API_URL=https://yourinstitution.instructure.com/
   CANVAS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   CANVAS_COURSE_ID=your_course_id
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment** (Recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

4. **Install dependencies within the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python download_canvas_submissions.py
   ```

## How It Works

- The script connects to Canvas using the provided API credentials.
- It retrieves all submissions from published assignments in the course.
- If a submission has an attached file, it downloads it into the `submissions/` directory.
- The script will create the `submissions/` directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.

## Adjusting `MAX_WORKERS`

`MAX_WORKERS` controls the level of concurrency, which will impact performance:

- **Increasing `MAX_WORKERS`**: Allows more simultaneous downloads, improving speed for large assignments. However, setting it too high may overload the system or Canvas API rate limits.
- **Decreasing `MAX_WORKERS`**: Reduces concurrency, which may help with API throttling but slows down downloads.

## Notes

- Ensure your API token has the necessary permissions to access course submissions.
- Submission downloads that fail are logged in `failed_downloads.txt`.
